class ViewPropertyBase(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for properties of a view.

    Properties define rules that help maintain the integrity and coherence of the events
    in the view. The properties are maintained by two strategies:

    1. Enforcing the property by removing events that violate it.
    2. Defining manipulation indices that restrict where the view can be modified.

    The main way views are manipulated (beyond adding new events in the course of a
    conversation) is in the condensers, which are designed to respect the manipulation
    indices. That means properties should hold inductively, and manipulation indices
    should be calculable purely from the events in the current view.

    Enforcement is intended as a fallback mechanism to handle edge cases, bad data, or
    unforeseen situations. Because enforcement assumes the view is in a bad state, it
    often requires a much larger perspective on the events and therefore depends on a
    sequence of _all_ events in the conversation.
