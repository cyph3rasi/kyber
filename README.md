**Your new favorite AI assistant.**

Set up in 60 seconds. Chat from Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, the web dashboard or the command line. Kyber runs on anything, and is a delight to use.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://kyber.chat/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. The installer detects your OS, installs dependencies, walks you through provider setup with model selection, writes your config, and optionally sets up system services.

## Why Kyber

⚡ **Fast setup** — One command installs, configures, and runs

🚀 **Never locks up** — Concurrent message handling means the bot keeps responding, even during long tasks

🔄 **Background tasks** — Kick off complex work without blocking the conversation

🔌 **Any provider** — OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

🔀 **Split providers** — Use one model for chat and a different one for background tasks

💬 **Chat where you are** — Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp out of the box

🛠️ **Built-in tools** — Web search, shell commands, GitHub, file I/O, and an extensible skills system

🌍 **Runs anywhere** — Laptop, VPS, Raspberry Pi. Optional system service keeps it always on

📊 **Dashboard** — Secure local web UI for config, model selection, and monitoring

⏰ **Scheduled tasks** — Cron jobs and heartbeat for proactive check-ins

🔒 **Security Center** — Environment audits, ClamAV malware scanning, Cisco AI Defense skill scanning, issue tracking, and scan history

🔐 **Secure by default** — API keys and tokens stored in a locked-down .env file, never in plaintext JSON
