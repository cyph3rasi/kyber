- ✅ **Search the web** — fetch pages, extract content
- ✅ **Schedule tasks** — cron jobs, recurring automation
- ✅ **Multi-channel** — Discord, Telegram, CLI, all synced
- ✅ **Skills & memory** — learns how you work, remembers across sessions
- ✅ **Subagents** — parallel processing for complex tasks

**One-line install:**

```bash

That's it. Run `kyber` and you're off to the races.
